The example feature dataset (YaleB_Jiang) used in this code is from Dr. Zhuolin Jiang: http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~zhuolin/projectlcksvd.html.

For the experiments on AR and caltech 101 dataset, we also used the feature datasets provided by Dr. Jiang.

For experiment on UCF50, we used the Action bank feature provided in: http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~jcorso/r/actionbank/. Please refer to our paper for the detailed experimental setting.
